Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.</td>\n",

       "27813    Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his skills I noticed this movie listed and was surprised I hadnt heard of it Id traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 2 1 2 years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production Now Patrick Swayze cant act for sour apples but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint dry Being curious I checked this sites production info It made a whopping < $600 per screen its opening weekend and just over $400 each after its months theater run in latter 2002 Overall gross was $261K which Id doubt could cover cast and crews hotel and food for a week on location The story is pretty benign and even the use of the usually interesting locale of Reno is as dull as the rest of the goings on Its something like several SNL bits all pieced together none individually too great at all and the overall presentation even worse Whatever the expenses for this production had to be considerable   even if all worked for less than their usual fees   so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bobs present albeit understandably somewhat laconic here  compared with his usual work Think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in Sling Blade Bandits and Bad Santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this One star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical Lifetime flick\n",
